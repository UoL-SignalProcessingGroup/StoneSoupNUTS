# Stone Soup goes NUTS
Tutorial repository for the paper submitted at FUSION 2025 with title: "Stone Soup goes NUTS: adding proposals and The 
No-U-Turn Sampler to Stone Soup"

## Abstract
Particle filters are essential for state estimation in non-linear and non-Gaussian systems, with performance hinging
on effective proposal distributions. This paper presents the implementation of Kalman Filter and No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)
proposals within the Stone Soup Python framework. The Kalman Filter proposal offers computational efficiency for structured
systems, while NUTS enables robust exploration of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate
the complementary strengths of these methods, enhancing Stone Soupâ€™s capabilities for diverse state estimation challenges

## Community engagement
The code shared can be run and modifief for various uses. We refer to the [Stone Soup](https://github.com/dstl/Stone-Soup)
community for further examples on how to use the framework, raise issues on the implementation and proposing and 
implementing improvements. 


### Installation
This code builts on top of [Stone Soup](https://github.com/dstl/Stone-Soup), until the PR with the added code is 
not pushed to the main branch and version the installation points to a fork with the relevant code.
In the future, we will upate the installation guide to ease running this tutorial.
