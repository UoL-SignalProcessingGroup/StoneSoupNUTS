## Abstract
Particle filters are essential for state estimation in non-linear and non-Gaussian systems, with performance hinging
on effective proposal distributions. This paper presents the implementation of Kalman Filter and No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)
proposals within the Stone Soup Python framework. The Kalman Filter proposal offers computational efficiency for structured
systems, while NUTS enables robust exploration of complex, high-dimensional distributions. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate
the complementary strengths of these methods, enhancing Stone Soupâ€™s capabilities for diverse state estimation challenges

## Community engagement
The code shared can be run and modifief for various uses. We refer to the [Stone Soup](https://github.com/dstl/Stone-Soup)
community for further examples on how to use the framework, raise issues on the implementation and proposing and 
implementing improvements. 


### Installation

To install and test the code provided you can use a virtual environment.
How to set up a virtual environemnt:

```unix
python3 -m venv <name_of_venv>
```

#### Activate the venv

##### Unix
```bash
source <name_of_venv>/bin/activate
```

##### Windows
```powershell
.\<name_of_venv>\Scripts\activate
```

Then you can install all the dependencies by doing:
```bash
python -m pip install -e .[dev]
```

#### Please note:
This code is built on top of [Stone Soup](https://github.com/dstl/Stone-Soup) and when the code will be reviewed and included
in the main branch we will update the installation guide for easier running of the tutorial.
